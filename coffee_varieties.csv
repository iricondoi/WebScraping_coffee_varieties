It is a tall variety characterized by relatively low production, susceptibility to the major diseases, and excellent cup quality.
French missionaries introduced Bourbon from Yemen to Bourbon Island (now La Réunion)—giving it the name it has today—in the early 1700s. Until the mid-19th century, Bourbon did not leave the island. But beginning in the mid-1800s, the variety spread to new parts of the world as the missionaries moved to establish footholds in Africa and the Americas. 
The Bourbon variety was introduced to Brazil around 1860, and from there rapidly spread north into other parts of South and Central America, where it is still cultivated today. Here it became mixed with other Bourbon-related varieties, introduced from India as well as Ethiopian landraces. Nowadays, there are many Bourbon-like varieties found in East Africa, but none exactly match the distinct Bourbon variety that can be found in Latin America.
Today in Latin America, Bourbon itself has largely been replaced by varieties that descend from it (notably including Caturra, Catuai, and Mundo Novo), although Bourbon itself it is still cultivated in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Peru.";None;This plant is in the public domain;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/img_2785-640x427-q50.jpg

The introduction to Malawi was part of a program financed by the European Union (EU) to rehabilitate the farms of smallholder coffee producers by gradually replacing the aging populations of Agaro and Geisha varieties with higher yielding Catimors, which would also enable coffee leaf rust and CBD to be controlled without the need for costly fungicide sprays. Of the five Catimor lines introduced, only one—Cat129—showed some resistance to CBD.

The plant is highly productive compared to Bourbon, in part because of its small size, which allows plants to be closely spaced; it can be planted at nearly double the density. The plant’s shape makes it relatively easy apply pest and disease treatments. It is mainly characterized by great vigor and its low height; it is less compact than Caturra. It is highly susceptible to coffee leaf rust.
Catuaí derives from the Guarani multo mom, meaning “very good."" Today, it is considered to have good but not great cup quality. There are yellow-fruited and red-fruited types, and have since been many selections in different countries. The cultivar was created in 1949 from a crossing of yellow Caturra and Mundo Novo, and initially called H-2077. 
The variety was released in Brazil 1972 after pedigree selection (selection of individual plants through successive generations) and is in wide cultivation there. In Brazil, there are multiple lines of Catuai available; some are notable for their high productivity. The Catuaí lines transferred to Central America seem to be less productive; studies in Honduras and Costa Rica found no significant differences in productivity have been observed between Caturra and Catuaí.
It was first introduced in Honduras in 1979, where it was tested by Instituto Hondureño del Café (IHCAFÉ). It was released commercially in 1983, after IHCAFÉ selected two lines for planting. In Honduras today, Catui accounts for nearly half of the Arabica coffee in cultivation. Researchers at IHCAFÉ are actively pursuing breeding with Catuai, including creating hybrid crosses between Catuai and Timor Hybrid lines.
It is also economically important in Costa Rica, where a yellow-fruiting Catuai was introduced in 1985, whose descendants have spread widely through the country. It was introduced into Guatemala in 1970; currently about 20% of the country’s production is Catuai. It has a negligible presence in other Central American countries.
Catuai, whose small stature allows it to be planted densely and harvested more efficiently, led in part to the intensification of full-sun coffee cultivation in Central America in the 1970s and 1980s.
A similar variety called Garnica was developed by the Mexican Coffee Institute (INMECAFÉ)  in 1960-61, through the crossing of Mundo Novo  with Caturra Amarillo. Adaptation trials were established in 1978-79, but INMECAFÉ was dissolved in 1989 before pedigree selections were completed.

It was discovered on a plantation in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil sometime between 1915 and 1918. 
Caturra has a single-gene mutation that causes the plant to grow smaller (called dwarfism). Its name derives from the Guarani word meaning ""small."" It is also called ""Nanico."" After Caturra’s discovery, selections were made by the Instituto Agronomico (IAC) of Sao Paulo State in Campinas, Brazil, starting in 1937. Breeders were interested in Caturra’s small size, which allows plants to be placed closer together, and its closely spaced secondary branches, which enable it to produce more fruit in the same space.
The selection process for Caturra was called mass selection, meaning that a group of individuals are selected based on their superior performance, seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation, and then the process is repeated. The variety was never officially released in Brazil, but has become common in Central America.
It was introduced in Guatemala in the 1940s, but widespread commercial adoption didn’t happen for another three decades. From Guatemala, it was introduced to Costa Rica, Honduras, and Panama. Today, it is one of the most economically important coffees in Central America, to the extent that it is often used as a “benchmark” against which new cultivars are tested. In Colombia, Caturra was thought to represent nearly half of the country’s production until a government-sponsored program beginning in 2008 incentivised renovation of over three billion coffee trees with the leaf-rust resistant Castillo variety (which has Caturra parentage). 
Caturra led in part to the intensification of coffee cultivation through higher density planting, often in full sun, that took place in the region in the second half of the 20th century. 
Caturra is also known for being one of the parents the so-called “Catimor” family of cultivars. Various lines of the coffee-leaf-rust-resistant Timor Hybrid were crossed with Caturra to produce a dwarf plant with rust resistance. Examples of Catimor varieties include: Costa Rica 95, Catisic, Lempira, and IHCAFE 90.

It was distributed throughout Panama via CATIE in the 1960s after it had been recognized for tolerance to coffee leaf rust. However, the plant's branches were brittle and not favored by farmers so it was not widely planted. The coffee came to prominence in 2005 when the Peterson family of Boquete, Panama, entered it into the ""Best of Panama"" competition and auction. It received exceptionally high marks and broke the then-record for green coffee auction prices, selling for over $20/pound.
There is significant confusion about Geisha because there are multiple genetically distinct plant types that have been referred to as Geisha, many of which share similar geographic origins in Ethiopia. Recent genetic diversity analyses conducted by World Coffee Research confirm that Panamanian Geisha descendent from T2722 is distinct and uniform. It is associated with extremely high cup quality when the plants are managed well at high altitude, and is known for its delicate floral, jasmine, and peach-like aromas.
The spellings Geisha and Gesha are often used interchangeably, relating to the fact that there is no set translation from the dialects of Ethiopia to English. The coffee was first recorded in germplasm records with the spelling “Geisha,” and coffee researchers and germplasm banks have mostly maintained that spelling over many decades, leading that spelling to be promoted and used first in the coffee industry.

As indicated by the name, the variety was introduced to the island of Java directly from Ethiopia by the Dutch in the early 19th century.
It was originally thought to be a Typica selection. In the mid-20th century, it was brought to Cameroon by a local farmer via the Vilmorin company, which acquired the seeds in Java from Porteres (a famous breeder). In Cameroon, the breeder Pierre Bouharmont observed that it was partially tolerant to coffee berry disease (CBD), a prevalent problem for coffee growers in Africa, and well adapted for smallholder growers using few inputs. After nearly 20 years of selection, it was released for cultivation in Cameroon in 1980-90.
It was originally thought to be a Typica selection. But genetic fingerprinting of molecular markers has revealed that Java is a selection from an Ethiopian landrace population called Abysinia.
It was introduced to Costa Rica in 1991 by the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD) by breeder Benoit Bertrand. The objective was to provide options for smallholders using low inputs, as well as for CBD tolerance (CBD is not currently present in Central America, but there is concern it may move to the region). Seeds were sent to PROMECAFE countries, but it was never released in any of the countries. Subsequently Java’s quality potential at high altitudes has been recognized. The first Central American country to officially recognize Java was Panama in 2016.

The origin of Mibirizi is poorly documented. According to the Belgian coffee historian Edmund  Leplae, it was introduced from Guatemala by the German administration in Rwanda in the 1910s. It was called “Guatemala” and would most likely have Typica lineage, because Guatemala was planted 100% in Typica at that time. Guatemala was distributed by the German colonial administration to Rwandan Catholic missions in the 1920s, including Mibirizi in western Rwanda. This population in Mibirizi was well maintained and was the source for the introduction of Mibirizi seeds to the germplasm collection at Mulungu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is very likely that Mibirizi plants were then mixed with French Mission plants (which belong to the Bourbon lineage; see SL34 for more) introduced from Kenya. Some breeding was initiated in the Mibirizi population and several lines were compared at the Rubona Coffee Research Station (near Huye, Rwanda) during the 1950s. However, it is not clear if any specific Mibirizi lines were released for farmers, or if the Mibirizi growing today originated from pre-existing Mibirizi plantations.

Catimor (female parent) x multicross selection involving K7, SL28, N39, Rume Sudan, among others (male parent).;F1 Hybrid (Introgressed);"Ruiru 11 is a compact, high yielding variety developed in Kenya to allow for more intensive coffee production with fewer losses from diseases and pests. 
Ruiru 11 owes its existence to a coffee berry disease (CBD) epidemic in 1968 that lead to the loss of 50% of Kenya’s production. The crisis sparked action. In the 1970s, the coffee research station at Ruiru, which gives Ruiru 11 its name, began an intensive breeding program for varieties that were immune to CBD. This led to the development of Ruiru 11, which was released in 1985. 
Breeders were focused on creating a compact variety suited to intensive planting, but one that had the high cup quality characteristic of the tall varieties predominant in Africa.  Breeders spend many years crossing multiple progenitors to create what breeders call a complex hybrid that would gather the best attributes each of the chosen progenitors. This work resulted in the creation the male parent of Ruiru. The chosen progenitors of Ruiru 11’s complex hybrid male parent conferred resistance to CBD (coming from Rume Sudan, Timor Hybrid lines, and K7) and good cup quality (coming from N39, SL28, SL34 and Bourbon). 
The female parent of Ruiru 11 was chosen to provide compactness (dwarf stature) and an additional layer of both rust and CBD resistance. A small number of Catimor (Caturra x Timor Hybrid) lines were identified to fulfill this requirement (including Catimor 129). 
The final step in the creation of Ruiru 11 is to cross the tall male complex hybrid parent with the compact Catimor female parent. The resulting group of siblings produces Ruiru 11’s compact stature and resistance to coffee leaf rust and CBD. To mass propagate Ruiru 11, breeders manually pollinate the mother plants with pollen from the male parent lines to produce first-generation (F1) hybrid seed. This final cross results in hybrid vigor, hence high yield. The resulting seeds produce a set of siblings that are mixed together and distributed to farmers. This is called a composite variety.  
Because Ruiru 11 relies on hand pollination for mass propagation, it has been difficult to produce adequate volumes of seed to meet farmer demand.";Coffee Research Foundation (now Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization, KALRO);This plant is registered in the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV);https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/ruiru11-640x475-q50.jpg

It has consequently spread from Kenya, where it was originally selected in the 1930s, to other parts of Africa (it is important in Arabica-growing regions of Uganda, in particular) and now to Latin America. The variety is suited for medium to high altitudes and shows resistance to drought, but is susceptible to the major diseases of coffee. SL28 is notable for its rusticity—a quality meaning that it can be left untended for years or even decades at a time, and then return to successful production. There are SL28 trees in many parts of Kenya that are 60-80 years old and still productive. 
SL28 was selected at the former Scott Agricultural Laboratories (now the National Agricultural Laboratories, NARL situated at Kabete—more information below).  Individual tree selections made at the Scott Laboratories during the 1935-1939 period were prefixed SL. Fourty-two trees of various origins were selected and studied for yield, quality, and drought and disease resistance. SL28 was selected in 1935 from a single tree in a population called Tanganyika Drought Resistant. In 1931, the senior coffee officer of Scott Labs, A.D. Trench, conducted a tour of  Tanganyika (now Tanzania). According to historical documents, he noticed a variety growing in the Moduli district that appeared to be tolerant to drought, diseases and pests. Seed was collected and brought back to Scott Laboratories, where its drought resistance was confirmed. It was widely distributed until superseded by its progeny, SL28. SL28 was considered the prize selection of this period of intensive breeding.
Recent genetic tests have confirmed that SL28 is related to the Bourbon genetic group.
History of Scott Agricultural Laboratories
Scott Agricultural Laboratories (now the National Agricultural Laboratories, NARL) was established by the colonial British government in Kenya in 1922. It conducted agricultural research and provided technical advice and training to Kenyan farmers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture. Scott Agricultural Labs employed an entomologist, a mycologist, and a plant breeder. The Coffee Section, previously housed in a central office of the department, was moved to the laboratories in 1934 and had twenty-four acres dedicated to coffee. The name of the unit was derived from the history of its buildings. Constructed in 1913 as a sanatorium and used during the First World War as a war hospital, the buildings were named for Dr. Henry Scott, a missionary from the Church of Scotland. When the Department of Agriculture took over the buildings in 1922, they named them the Scott Agricultural Laboratories. Both Scott Agricultural Laboratories in Kenya and Lyamungo Research Station in Tanganyika became the main centers for coffee breeding in East Africa.
Research was conducted at the lab and in cooperation with private estate owners. A history of the labs states: “The trial of imported varieties is a conspicuous feature of the work at the Laboratories…. Selections from individual trees showing desirable characteristics are being grown.” Other coffee work included comparative yield trials, grafting experiments, and effects of pruning, shade trials, and cover crops, among others. In 1944, Kenya decided to move coffee research to a dedicated coffee research station with better facilities for field experiments; Jacaranda Estates (20 miles north of Ruiru) with 380 acres. It became operational in 1949.  Substations were also established in Upper Kiambu in 1957, Meru in 1958, Kitale in 1938, Lake Victoria in 1959, and Kisii in 1957.";Scott Agricultural Laboratories;This plant is in the public domain;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/dscf9291-640x427-q50.jpg

Individual tree selections made at the Scott Laboratories in Kenya during the 1935-1939 period were prefixed “SL.” SL34 was selected from a single tree on the Loresho Estate in Kabete, Kenya since research at the Scott Laboratories was often conducted in cooperation with local, private estate owners. The tree was labeled “French Mission.” 
French missionaries known as Spiritans established a mission in 1893 at Bura (Taita Hills, Kenya), in which Bourbon coffee seeds originating from La Réunion island were planted. The seedlings from Bura were brought to another French Mission in Saint Austin (near Nairobi) in 1899, and from there seeds were distributed to settlers willing to grow coffee. This is the origin of so-called French Mission coffee. 
Because of the historical movement of coffee seeds directly from La Réunion via the French missionaries, French Mission is widely understood to be another name for Bourbon. However, recent genetic tests have indicated that SL34 is related to the Typica genetic group. It is possible that the original story about SL34 being selected from a French Mission population could be incorrect.";Scott Agricultural Laboratories;This plant is in the public domain;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/sweetmarias-sl34-640x400-q50.jpg

Starmaya is the only F1 hybrid in the world propagated by seed, rather than through costly biotechnology. Before Starmaya, the only way to efficiently reproduce F1 hybrids for farmers has been through cloning (tissue culture cloning/somatic embryogenesis) or manual pollination of the mother and father plants, both of which methods are costly and have limited capacity.  
Typically, F1 hybrid parents are chosen to be  genetically distant from one another; this distance maximizes hybrid vigor, which translates into high yields and overall vigor (for example, tolerance to frost), without losses in cup quality or disease resistance. There are only a handful of F1 hybrid coffee varieties in the world, most developed in the last 10 years, and only recently commercially available to farmers. 
As early as 1998, coffee breeders recognized that it would be theoretically possible to propagate F1 hybrids via seed if one of the parent plants were sterile. If you place two different fertile coffee varieties—your desired hybrid Mother and Father varieties—together in a typical field of coffee, some offspring would be the result of Mother to Mother crossing (resulting in offspring that look like the Mother), some Father to Father (offspring like the Father), and only some would be Mother to Father (offspring hybrids of the two). This is obviously an inefficient way to produce hybrid seed.
However, if one of the varieties in the field is sterile (meaning it does not produce pollen), then any offspring (e.g., coffee cherries, the product of sexual reproduction of the Mother and Father) that appear on male sterile plants must be hybrids between Mother x Father. Wind or pollinators would carry the pollen from the pollen-producing variety onto the sterile variety, and the resulting cherries would necessarily be hybrids. The challenge was to find a naturally male sterile plant that could be a suitable breeding parent.
In 2001, researchers from Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement (CIRAD) collaborating in a public-private coffee breeding project with ECOM, noticed a male-sterile Arabica plant growing in a population of wild Ethiopian and Sudanese coffees on the La Cumplida farm in Nicaragua. Breeders crossed it with Marsellesa, a newer-generation rust-resistant variety (Timor Hybrid 832/2 x Villa Sarchi CIFC 971/10).

Detailed history of the Sarchimor group  of varieties
In 1958 or 1959, the Centro de Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro of Portugal (CIFC), famous for its research into coffee leaf rust, received a lot of Timor Hybrid seeds from the island of Timor. Timor Hybrid  is a natural cross between C. arabica and C. canephora (Robusta)  that appeared spontaneously on the island of Timor in 1920s. Its Robusta genetics conferred rust resistance into the variety. From the two shipments of seeds that CIFC received, they had selected two plants for use in breeding based on their high resistance to leaf rust.  In 1967, breeders in Portugal began work to create new varieties of coffee that would be resistant to the disease, but also have a compact stature that could be planted more densely. One of the rust-resistant Timor Hybrid plants, called HDT CIFC 832/2, was crossed with compact Villa Sarchi to create hybrid 361 (H361). The hybrid was dubbed “Sarchimor.”
They created the hybrid just in time for the arrival of leaf rust in the Americas. 
After some initial testing at IAC in Brazil, in 1971 CIFC sent H361 out for field trials in experimental centers in several countries, including Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Sao Tome, Thailand and Venezuela. In response to the crisis, Central American countries banded together to form the Regional Cooperative Program for the Technological Development and Modernization of the Coffee Industry (PROMECAFE) in 1978. 
In Central America, H361 was first sent to the Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE) research station in Costa Rica. The population studied there was given the designation T5296 (“T” represents Turrialba, where CATIE is based). The work of selective breeding on T5296 was led by researcher AJ Bettencourt. From this central trial, T5296 was sent out to national breeding programs in the region. In Honduras, further generations of selection led to the variety that is known as Parainema. In El Salvador, further generations of selection led to the variety that is known as Cuscatleco. In Puerto Rico, the Sarchimor population was called Limani. Similar selections were done in Brazil to create Obata, Tupi, and IAPAR 59.
It’s important to note that, contrary to common belief, ""Sarchimor"" is not iteself a distinct variety.

The selection process for Tekisic was called ""mass selection,"" meaning that a group of individuals are selected based on their superior performance, seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation, and then the process is repeated. Breeders achieved a variety that ripens early, has very good quality potential on optimal conditions, and has higher production than unselected Bourbons between 900 and 1500 meters. Unfortunately, the variety is not resistant to major diseases including coffee leaf rust.
The name Tekisic comes from tekiti, a word meaning “work” in the Nahuatl language, and ISIC. It was indeed a lot of work to create the variety—the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) spent nearly 30 years performing selections to create it, beginning in the 1949 and culminating with its release in 1977. It is widespread in El Salvador, where Tekisic and unselected Bourbon make up nearly 70% of coffee production. It is also economically important in Guatemala.
Since Tekisic is merely a selection of the Bourbon variety, the story of Tekisic is really the story of Bourbon—one of the most culturally and genetically important C. Arabica coffees in the world. For more, see Bourbon.  Latin America breeders such as those at ISIC have exploited the narrow genetic base of Bourbon to create new cultivars that have improved performance in various traits—yield, quality, etc.";Instituto Salvadoreño de Investigaciones del Café (ISIC);This plant is in the public domain;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/tekisic_1-640x427-q50.jpg

It is a tall variety characterized by very low production, susceptibility to the major diseases, and good cup quality.
The Typica group, like all Arabica coffee, is supposed to have originated in southwestern Ethiopia. Sometime in the 15th or 16th century, it was taken to Yemen. By 1700, seeds from Yemen were being cultivated in India. In 1696 and 1699, coffee seeds were sent from the Malabar coast of India to the island of Batavia (today called Java in Indonesia).  These few seeds were the ones to give rise to what we now know as the distinct Typica variety. In 1706 a single Typica coffee plant was taken from Java to Amsterdam and given a home in the botanical gardens; from there, a plant was shared with France in 1714. 
From the Netherlands, Typica was sent in 1719 on colonial trade routes to Dutch Guiana (now Suriname) and then on to Cayenne (French Guiana) in 1722, and from there to the northern part of Brazil in 1727. It reached southern Brazil between 1760 and 1770.  From Paris, plants were sent to to Martinique in the West Indies in 1723. The English introduced Typica coffee from Martinique to Jamaica in 1730. It reached Santo Domingo in 1735. From Santo Domingo, seeds were sent to Cuba in 1748. Later on, Costa Rica (1779) and El Salvador (1840) received seeds from Cuba. 
In the late eighteenth century, cultivation spread to the Caribbean (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo), Mexico and Colombia, and from there across Central America (it was grown in El Salvador as early as 1740). Until the 1940s, the majority of coffee plantations in South and Central America were planted with Typica. Because Typica is both low yielding and highly susceptible to major coffee diseases, it has gradually been replaced across much of the Americas, but is still widely planted in Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, where it is called Jamaica Blue Mountain.";None;This plant is in the public domain;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/typica_1-640x427-q50.jpg

The variety was discovered in Costa Rica in the 1950s or 1960s in the northwestern region of the province of Alajuela, and has subsequently undergone pedigree selection (selection of individual plants through successive generations) there. It is not widely grown outside Costa Rica, though was introduced to Honduras in 1974 by IHCAFE. 
It is known for being well-adpated to the highest altitude conditions and tolerant of strong winds. 
Villa Sarchi is perhaps most well known as one of the namesakes of the “Sarchimor” group of coffees. In the 1970s, coffee breeders and growers in Latin America, as well as the global coffee industry that depended on coffee from the region, were extremely concerned about the recent arrival of coffee leaf rust in Latin America. 
In 1958 or 1959, the Centro de Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro of Portugal (CIFC), famous for its research into coffee leaf rust, received two shipments of Timor Hybrid seeds. Timor Hybrid is a natural cross between Arabica and Robusta that appeared spontaneously on the island of East Timor in 1920s. Its Robusta genetics conferred rust resistance into the variety. From the two shipments of seeds that CIFC received, breeders selected two plants for use in breeding based on their high resistance to leaf rust. In 1967,  CIFC breeders began work to create new varieties of coffee that would be resistant to coffee leaf rust, but also have a compact stature that could be planted more densely. One of the rust-resistant Timor Hybrid plants, called HDT CIFC 832/2, was crossed with compact Villa Sarchi to create hybrid 361 (H361). The hybrid was dubbed “Sarchimor.” (Crosses made with compact Caturra were dubbed ""Catimor."")";Instituto del Café de Costa Rica (ICAFE);This plant is in the public domain;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iricondoi/WebScraping_coffee_varieties/main/imagenes/villa-sarchi-5-640x480-q50.jpg
